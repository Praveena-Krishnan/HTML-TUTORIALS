           <p>PIZZERIA was launched on May 31, 1958, by two brothers, Dan and Frank Carney, both Wichita State students, 
            as a single location in Wichita, Kansas. Six months later they opened a second outlet, and within a year they were operating 
            six locations.
            One early employee was future Pro Football Hall of Fame head coach Bill Parcells, who had worked for the company while a 
            college student and football player at Wichita State University. Parcells was considering a franchise for a career (as well as law school),
             but instead chose to enter coaching, eventually becoming a head coach in the National Football League.
